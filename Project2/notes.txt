Project 2 - OpenMP: Numeric Integration with OpenMP
Due April 28

Intro:
    Bezier surfaces = analytically defined shapes - rendered to any precision
    We're going to use numerical techniques to find volume b/w two surfaces
    X and Y dimensions: NUMNODES x NUMNODES - take NUMNODES^2 height samples
    Each height sample on 2D 'tile'
    Tiles in middle are full-sized; edges 1/2; corners 1/4

Requirements:
    Using OpenMP, compute total volume b/w surfaces
    Use variety of number of subdivisions (NUMNODES) - pick at least 8
    Use variety of number of threads (NUMT) - use at least 1, 2, 4
    Record data in units of something that gets larger as speed increases
        e.g. MegaHeights Computed Per Second
        can use something else
    
    Use "Inverse Amdahl's Law" to determined parallel fraction
    From Fp, determine max speed-up EVER possible with infinite cores / threads

PDF Commentary:
    1. What machine run on
    2. Actual volume (your calculation)
    3. Performances achieved in tables and graphs as function of NUMNODES and NUMT
    4. Describe what patterns you're seeing
    5. Why do you think you see this behavior?
    6. What is Pf for this application, using inverse Amdahl equation?
    7. Given the Pf, what is the maximum speed-up you could EVER get?
